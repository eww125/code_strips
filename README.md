Let's build an API for Codestrips! Codestrips is a small application to allow users to create and save small one-pane comic strips. You can select a head, body, background location, thought/speech bubble type, thought/speech bubble text, and caption for a strip. By the end of this project, you'll be able to save these to a SQLite database and retrieve them so that they persist even when you restart your server.

You'll use your knowledge of Express, SQLite, and the `sqlite3` node module in order to create a Strip table and then set up a POST route for creating new strips and a GET route to retrieve all strips from the database.

You can start your server from the terminal window with `node app.js` and kill it with the `Ctrl + C` key command.

As you progress through the steps, you can test your work by interacting with the front-end web browser component or by running a test suite. To run the test suite in the terminal, enter the `mocha` command. This will run a test suite for all steps of the project. You won't be able to run the server and test script in the same terminal window at the same time, so either kill your server before running the test script or open a second terminal window to run `mocha`.

Setting up the project

1. In your terminal window, use `npm` to install `express`.
